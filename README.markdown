# RaphaÃ«l

Cross-browser vector graphics the easy way. Visit the library website for more information: [http://raphaeljs.com](http://raphaeljs.com/)

This fork is intended to add group functionality via the SVG `<g>` element and the VML `<v:group>` element.

The intended goal is only to be able to transform groups of elements the same way they can be transformed in their native MLs.
